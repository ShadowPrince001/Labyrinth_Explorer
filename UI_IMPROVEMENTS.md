# UI Improvements for Difficulty Selection

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Spacing
- Added blank line at the top for better visual separation
- Added blank line before buttons at the bottom
- Maintains clean, readable layout

### 2. Improved Information Display
**Before:**
```
▶ EASY (6d5)
  Higher starting stats for a gentler experience. Roll 6d5 (6-30 range) for each attribute.
  Stat Range: 6-30
```

**After:**
```
▶ EASY (6d5)
  Higher starting stats for a gentler experience.
  Roll 6d5 (6-30 range) for each attribute.
  Stat Range: 6-30
```

### 3. Better Text Organization
- Separated description from dice information
- Made dice roll information explicit: "Roll 6d5 (6-30 range) for each attribute"
- Kept stat range as separate line for clarity

### 4. Clean Description Text
- Removed redundant dice information from main description
- Descriptions are now concise and focused on experience level
- Dice details moved to dedicated line

## Visual Output

The improved UI now displays as:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║       SELECT YOUR DIFFICULTY LEVEL        ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝

▶ EASY (6d5)
  Higher starting stats for a gentler experience.
  Roll 6d5 (6-30 range) for each attribute.
  Stat Range: 6-30

▶ NORMAL (5d5)
  Balanced starting stats for the intended experience.
  Roll 5d5 (5-25 range) for each attribute.
  Stat Range: 5-25

▶ HARD (4d5)
  Lower starting stats for a challenging experience.
  Roll 4d5 (4-20 range) for each attribute.
  Stat Range: 4-20

This choice affects your starting attributes only.
You cannot change difficulty once character creation begins.

[Buttons: Easy (6d5) | Normal (5d5) | Hard (4d5)]
```
