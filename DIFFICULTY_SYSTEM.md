# Difficulty Selection System

## Overview
The difficulty selection system allows players to choose their preferred level of challenge when creating a new character. This choice affects **only the starting attribute rolls** and does not impact any other game mechanics.

## Features

### Three Difficulty Levels

1. **Easy (6d5)**
   - Dice Formula: 6d5 (6 dice with 5 sides each)
   - Stat Range: 6-30
   - Average Roll: ~18
   - Description: "Higher starting stats for a gentler experience"

2. **Normal (5d5)** - Default
   - Dice Formula: 5d5 (5 dice with 5 sides each)
   - Stat Range: 5-25
   - Average Roll: ~15
   - Description: "Balanced starting stats for standard difficulty"

3. **Hard (4d5)**
   - Dice Formula: 4d5 (4 dice with 5 sides each)
   - Stat Range: 4-20
   - Average Roll: ~12
   - Description: "Lower starting stats for experienced players"

## User Flow

1. Player selects "New Game" from main menu
2. **Difficulty selection screen appears** with:
   - Clear title and borders
   - Three difficulty options with descriptions
   - Stat ranges for each difficulty
   - Warning that choice cannot be changed
3. Player selects a difficulty
4. Game proceeds to story intro ‚Üí character creation
5. Difficulty is used only during attribute rolling

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The system is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind:

```python
# Configuration Dictionary (line ~93-113)
DIFFICULTY_CONFIG = {
    "easy": {
        "name": "Easy",
        "dice": "6d5",
        "description": "Higher starting stats...",
    },
    "normal": {
        "name": "Normal", 
        "dice": "5d5",
        "description": "Balanced starting stats...",
    },
    "hard": {
        "name": "Hard",
        "dice": "4d5", 
        "description": "Lower starting stats...",
    }
}
```

### State Management

- New field added to `EngineState` dataclass (line ~87-88):
  ```python
  difficulty: str = "normal"  # "easy" | "normal" | "hard"
  ```
- Difficulty is set once during selection and persists throughout character creation
- Cannot be changed after character creation begins

### Phase Flow

The new phase flow includes difficulty selection:

```
main_menu ‚Üí select_difficulty ‚Üí intro:story ‚Üí intro:startup ‚Üí create_name ‚Üí create_attrs ‚Üí ...
```

### Helper Method

Centralized dice formula retrieval (line ~118-121):

```python
def _get_stat_roll_dice(self) -> str:
    """Get the dice formula based on current difficulty."""
    config = self.DIFFICULTY_CONFIG.get(
        self.s.difficulty, 
        self.DIFFICULTY_CONFIG["normal"]
    )
    return config["dice"]
```

### Stat Rolling Integration

Original hardcoded rolls replaced with dynamic calls:

**Before:**
```python
self.s.pending_roll = roll_damage("5d4")
```

**After:**
```python
self.s.pending_roll = roll_damage(self._get_stat_roll_dice())
```

Changed at two locations:
- Line ~410: Initial attribute roll in `_handle_create_name()`
- Line ~696: Subsequent rolls in `_handle_create_attrs()`

### UI Handler

New handler method `_handle_difficulty_selection()` (line ~224-312):
- Displays formatted difficulty selection screen
- Processes difficulty selection actions (`difficulty:easy`, `difficulty:normal`, `difficulty:hard`)
- Routes to story intro after selection
- Shows stat ranges and descriptions for informed choice

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite included in `tools/test_difficulty.py`:

### Test Coverage

1. ‚úÖ **Configuration Test**: Verifies all three difficulties exist
2. ‚úÖ **Dice Formula Test**: Confirms correct formulas (6d5, 5d5, 4d5)
3. ‚úÖ **State Field Test**: Validates difficulty field exists with default "normal"
4. ‚úÖ **Helper Method Test**: Tests dice retrieval for all difficulties
5. ‚úÖ **Flow Test**: Verifies phase transition from main menu ‚Üí difficulty selection
6. ‚úÖ **UI Test**: Confirms menu displays with all three options
7. ‚úÖ **Roll Range Test**: Statistical verification of dice ranges:
   - Easy: 6-30 (avg ~18)
   - Normal: 5-25 (avg ~15)
   - Hard: 4-20 (avg ~12)

### Running Tests

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Maheeyan Saha\Downloads\Labyrinth_Explorer-main"
python tools\test_difficulty.py
```

Expected output:
```
============================================================
‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED!
============================================================
```

## Adding New Difficulties

The modular design makes it easy to add new difficulty levels:

1. **Add to Configuration** (line ~93-113):
   ```python
   DIFFICULTY_CONFIG = {
       # ... existing difficulties ...
       "extreme": {
           "name": "Extreme",
           "dice": "3d5",
           "description": "Brutal challenge with very low stats (3-15 range)",
           "color": "red"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Update UI Menu** (line ~304-310):
   ```python
   self._emit_menu([
       ("difficulty:easy", "Easy (6d5)"),
       ("difficulty:normal", "Normal (5d5)"),
       ("difficulty:hard", "Hard (4d5)"),
       ("difficulty:extreme", "Extreme (3d5)")  # Add new option
   ])
   ```

3. **Update Loop** (line ~280-295):
   ```python
   for key, config in [
       ("easy", self.DIFFICULTY_CONFIG["easy"]),
       ("normal", self.DIFFICULTY_CONFIG["normal"]),
       ("hard", self.DIFFICULTY_CONFIG["hard"]),
       ("extreme", self.DIFFICULTY_CONFIG["extreme"])  # Add new entry
   ]:
   ```

That's it! The helper method `_get_stat_roll_dice()` automatically handles the new difficulty.

## Design Decisions

### Why Only Stat Rolling?

The difficulty choice affects **only** character creation stat rolls because:
- Keeps system simple and predictable
- Doesn't require balancing all game mechanics
- Player skill still matters for combat/exploration
- Easy to understand and test
- Modular for future expansion

### Why d5 Dice?

Changed from original d4 to d5 dice:
- Simulation revealed characters were rolling with wrong dice
- d5 provides better stat distribution
- Clearer differentiation between difficulties:
  - 6d5 vs 5d5 vs 4d5 = 6 stat point difference in averages
  - More impactful player choice

### Why Three Levels?

- **Easy**: For new players or story-focused gameplay
- **Normal**: Balanced default experience  
- **Hard**: For veterans seeking challenge
- Three options avoid decision paralysis
- Can easily expand to 4-5 if needed

## Future Enhancements

Possible expansions while maintaining modularity:

2. **Difficulty-Based Rewards**: Higher rewards for harder difficulties
3. **Difficulty Achievements**: Track completions per difficulty
4. **Mid-Game Difficulty**: Option to adjust difficulty later (new character only)
5. **Preset Challenges**: "Ironman" (1d5 stats), "Heroic" (8d5 stats), etc.
6. **Difficulty Persistence**: Save/load difficulty with game state

## Validation
