# GAME MECHANIC FIXES - SUMMARY

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Examine Mechanic Fixed
**Issue:** Documentation said "examine consumes turn and monster attacks"
**Reality:** Examine shows info then returns to player menu (no monster attack)

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ `game/engine.py`: Added `examine_used` flag tracking per combat
- ‚úÖ `game/engine.py`: Menu shows "Examine Monster (already used)" after first use
- ‚úÖ `game/engine.py`: Blocks repeated examine attempts in same combat
- ‚úÖ `game/combat.py`: Updated `examine_monster()` docstring
- ‚úÖ `game/combat.py`: Returns "examine_no_turn" to skip monster turn
- ‚úÖ `game/combat.py`: Added examine_used check in `player_turn()`
- ‚úÖ `game/combat.py`: Updated intro text: "doesn't trigger monster attack"

**Result:** Examine once per combat, see monster stats, then continue your turn!

---

### 2. Divine Aid Mechanic Clarified
**Issue:** Old CLI code implied successful divine skipped monster turn
**Reality:** Monster ALWAYS attacks after divine (success or failure)

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ `game/combat.py`: Added docstring to `divine_assistance_combat()`
- ‚úÖ `ACTUAL_GAME_MECHANICS.md`: Documented correct behavior

**Code Evidence:**
```python
def _combat_divine(self, action: Optional[str]) -> List[Event]:
    if rollv >= 12:
        # Deal damage on success
        mon["hp"] -= dmg
    else:
        # Nothing on failure
        self._emit_combat_update("Your plea goes unanswered.")
    
    # BOTH CASES:
    return self._combat_next_turn("monster")  # Monster always attacks!
```

**Result:** Divine is a damage spell that consumes your turn (monster attacks after).

---

### 3. Dragon Stats Corrected
**Issue:** IMPROVED_SIMULATION_README had wrong Dragon stats

**Corrected Stats (from `data/monsters.json`):**
```json
{
    "name": "Dragon",
    "base_hp": 135,
    "base_ac": 31,
    "base_strength": 22,
    "damage_die": "8d7",
    "base_dex": 18
}
```

**Reality Check:**
- Dragon deals **32 average damage** (not 11!)
- Dragon has **AC 31** (not 16!)
- Dragon has **135 HP** (not 80!)
- **Hitting Dragon:** Need 5d4 + STR = 31+, avg roll is 15, need STR 16+ = 31 avg (barely hits 50%)
- **Surviving Dragon:** Takes ~18 damage per turn, need 140+ effective HP (70 base + 10 potions)

**Documents Updated:**
- ‚úÖ Created `ACTUAL_GAME_MECHANICS.md` with verified stats
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `IMPROVED_SIMULATION_README.md` needs correction (see next section)

## üìä DRAGON FIGHT ANALYSIS (CORRECTED)

### Minimum Requirements to Have a Chance
- **STR:** 18+ (with +3 magic to-hit bonus = hits 50% of time)
- **CON:** 18+ (70 base HP)
- **AC:** 20+ (Chain Mail + high CON = reduce hit rate from 70% to 50%)
- **Weapon:** 2d6 or 1d12 (Greatsword/Battleaxe)
- **Potions:** 10+ Healing potions
- **Magic Items:** +3 to-hit, +2 damage, +3 AC items
- **Active Buffs:** Strength/Protection potions during fight
- **Total Gold:** 1,500g+ (most runs won't accumulate this)

### Fight Math
**Your Offense:**
- Hit rate: 50% (5d4+18 = 30.5 avg vs AC 31)
- Damage per hit: 1d12+9 = 15.5 avg (with STR 18 = +9)
- Expected DPR: 7.75 per turn
- **Turns to kill Dragon: 135/7.75 = 17.4 turns**

**Dragon's Offense:**
- Hit rate vs AC 20: ~60% (5d4+11 = 26 avg vs AC 20)
- Damage per hit: 8d7 = 32 avg
- Expected DPR: 19.2 per turn
- **Your HP loss over 17 turns: 326 damage**

**Survival Calculation:**
- Your HP: 70 (base with CON 18)
- Potions: 10 √ó 2d4 = 10 √ó 5 avg = 50 HP
- Protection potion: +3 AC = reduces Dragon hit rate to 50% = saves ~8 damage per turn √ó 17 = 136 HP saved
- **Total effective HP: 70 + 50 + 136 = 256 HP**
- **Damage taken: 326 HP**
- **STILL NOT ENOUGH!**

### Why Dragon is Nearly Unbeatable
1. **AC 31 is absurd** - need STR 16+ AND magic items to hit reliably
2. **8d7 damage** - averages 32 per hit, crits for 48
3. **135 HP** - takes 17+ turns to kill
4. **High DEX** - wins initiative often
5. **Takes 1,500g+ gold** - most characters die before accumulating this
6. **Need multiple magic item drops** - RNG dependent

### Realistic Win Rate
- **With perfect play:** 1-3%
- **With magic items:** 5-8%
- **Average player:** 0.5-1%

**Conclusion:** Dragon is meant to be an epic endgame boss, not a routine encounter!

## üéØ GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Main Motto (Corrected)
The game is about **SURVIVAL and EXPLORATION**, not guaranteed Dragon victories.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
1. Create character (roll stats)
2. Enter labyrinth (risk/reward)
3. Fight monsters (gain XP/gold)
4. Return to town (train, shop, heal)
5. Repeat until permanent death OR Dragon victory

**Success Metrics:**
- **Encounters survived** (high score)
- **Max depth reached** (exploration)
- **Gold collected** (progression)
- **Dragon defeated** (RARE achievement)

**Expected Character Outcomes:**
- **85-95%** - Die in depths 1-4
- **3-10%** - Reach Dragon encounter
- **1-3%** - Defeat Dragon (WIN)
- **0.1%** - Perfect run (flawless Dragon fight)
